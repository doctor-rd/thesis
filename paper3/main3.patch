< The proof of Lemma \ref{mitte} is the same as the proof of Lemma 3.2 in \cite{donau} for the case $G=\{\id_{[n]}\}$. It is easy to see that the acyclic matching, that is constructed in this proof, is $(S_1\times S_{n-1})$-equivariant.

< as follows. We add $n$ to the block that contains $1$ in each partition and append $v_n$ to the bottom of the chain, see Figure \ref{exmapping}. The map $\psi$ is an isomorphism of posets. A similar definition of $\psi$ as well as a detailed description of its inverse can be found in the proof of Lemma 4.1 in \cite{donau}.
