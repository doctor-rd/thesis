> Let $n>k\geq 2$. Let $\Pi_{n,k}$ denote the poset obtained from $\overline{\Pi}_n$ by removing all partitions where some block has more than $1$ and less than $k$ elements. We define $\Delta(\Pi_{n,k})$ to the nerve of the acyclic category $\Pi_{n,k}$, which is a regular trisp. Since $\Pi_{n,k}$ is a geometric lattice, $\Delta(\Pi_{n,k})$ is shellable, hence homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres, see \cite{bjoern}. We notice $\overline{\Pi}_n=\Pi_{n,2}$.

> In this section we study the case, where $G$ is the Young subgroup $S_1\times S_{n-1}:=\{\sigma\in S_n\mid\sigma(1)=1\}$. The main result is stated in Proposition \ref{mainresult}.
